        <h1>My background as a teacher is framed by teaching underserved, underrepresented and underfunded populations. I have taught in a sub-urban, rural district, an inner-city district and in three different mountain villages in Northern Macedonia.  I am an independent learner that is not afraid to try new things. Language, social and cultural differences are not a barrier for me. In special education I am known for innovation and advocacy. I am excellent at devising community based instruction and adapting grade level curriculum and materials to any ability or learning style. I am very familiar with the IEP process as well as positive behavior supports and the functional behavior intervention processes.  I innovate with technology and make learning feel real and relevant to keep my lessons as interesting and multi-modal as possible.
